We prepared this guide after seeing many questions regarding the purchase process, so here are the simple steps you take to make a purchase and add it to your site:

1. Go to **[our market](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)** and you **choose a product** 
2. Go through the **payment process** 
3. **Download** the product 
4. **Check your e-mail** (make sure it's the **same** one you used when you registered)

You should receive **two** **e-mails** from us:

* one thanking you for the purchase,
  
![first-e-mail](http://open-classifieds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/first-e-mail.png) 

* another with a purchase receipt as indicated in the screenshots below. **Please check the spam folder in your e-mail**, if you can't find one of them.

As you can see in those e-mails, the first one has your **log in information** for your portal here. And the second e-mail has your **license number.**

Another way to get your license number is to log in to your panel **[here](http://market.open-classifieds.com/oc-panel/auth/login)** and go to **Purchases**, there you will find your license number (as indicated in the below picture).

Hope that helps! and best regards from Kinan and Open Classifieds team.
