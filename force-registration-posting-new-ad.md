We weren't in favor of adding this feature to the software, but after many requests we decided to release it with our Open Classifieds 2.1.8 . Now you are able to force your users to register before they post any ad on your website. 

**To enable this feature you can follow these simple steps:** 

1. Log into your **Admin Panel** 
2. Go to **Settings** > **Advertisement > Publish Options** 
3. Set **Require login to post** value to **ON** 
4. Press **Save** 

And you're good to go! 

We found that the most convenient style for a theme with this feature is **[Newspaper theme](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/newspaper.html)** check the demo **[here](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/demo/newspaper.html)**.
