**Locations** make possible to segregate ads appearing in your classifieds by the place/city. Thanks to this users of the site can narrow their search only for the ads around their geographical territory.

## How to add locations

### Geonames

This is probably the easiest and fastest way to add multiple locations. What you have to do is to choose a location (Continent, Country, State/Province, County/Region or City) and press **Import** to import its sub-locations. <br>
For example, if you choose:<br>
Continent = Europe<br>
Country = Spain<br>
State/Province = Catalonia<br>
and then click Import, it will add Barcelona, Girona, Lleidia and Tarragona to your locations. 

Then, you can add the sub-locations of a location. <br>
If you have added Barcelona in your locations, click **Browse** on the right of this location. <br>
Then choose:<br>
Continent = Europe<br>
Country = Spain<br>
State/Province = Catalonia<br>
County/Region = Barcelona<br>
and click Import to add all the sub-locations of Barcelona.

### Quick method

At the quick location creator add the name of the location, hit **enter** on your keyboard and when you have done, press the '**Send**' button as explained in the following screenshot.

## How to manage locations

Like before: go to **Panel**, choose **Classifieds** > **Locations** on the left sidebar. 

Managing them is very easy. If you want to move locations and change their order you just need to drag and drop selected one to the chosen place.

To change something, e.g. name or description of the location, you can click **Edit** button.

To **delete** press red button with trash bin. Note, that when you delete parent locations inside of it will be moved level up - to the parent of the deleted location.

## Locations widget

Additional options to deal with locations are given by special widget.Â To activate it, go to **Panel** and choose **Apperance** > **Widgets** on the left sidebar. Choose **'Locations' widget** from the list and click **CREATE**. Name the widget's title and select if you want to display it in a sidebar or footer. You can also keep it **Inactive**. Thanks to this widget navigation between locations is easier. List of them will be displayed all the time at the side or in the bottom of the page.
