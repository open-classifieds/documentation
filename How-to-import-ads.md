It's much easier to import advertisements instead of inserting them one by one. Import tool for ads is a new feature included in our [2.4.0 release](http://open-classifieds.com/2015/04/28/open-classifieds-2-4-0/) as well as many other features. 

## How to use it

Create a CSV file with header: 
user_name user_email title description date category location price address phone website image_1 image_2 image_3 image_4

**user_name:** Name for user if doesn't exists will get created<br>
**user_email:** Email address of user if doesn't exists will get created<br>
**title:** Title of the ad, will be used later for the url for SEO<br>
**description:** Ad description details. Allows bbcode<br>
**date:** Published date, in format YYYY-MM-DD (for example 2014-05-09)<br>
**category:** Name of the category will be created if doesnt exists<br>
**location:** Name of the location will be created if doesnt exists<br>
**price:** Price, numeric (optional)<br>
**address:** Address of the ad, (optional)<br>
**phone:** Phone number (optional)<br>
**website:** Website (optional)

**Images:**

We allow up to 4 images. Images allow remote images like [http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/technics/](http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/technics/s) or local, using as base your site root, for example /images/import/ad1_pic3.png. The images will be downloaded, resized, thumbed, and deleted on completion.<br>
