If you're running a limited user classifieds website (could also be useful for larger websites) then chat is a powerful tool that would enhance your user experience. A couple of releases ago we added a chat widget to the list of widgets you could choose from.

**To add a chat box to your website you need to follow the next steps:** 

1. Log in to your **Admin Panel** 
2. Go to **Appearance** > **Widgets** 
3. Select **Chat** and press **Create**

4\. **Input your settings** (here you have to make sure that you input a name for your chat room that is unique and not used before, otherwise you will get an empty box) and select **Save Changes**

After following the steps you can visit your website and see the chat room functioning. 

**Some extras you can know about the chat widget:**

1. If you log in with Twitter your avatar would show on chat.
2. If you paste a link to an image, it will show the image inline. Also, pasted URLs will turn into links.
3. There is some (limited) Markdown support: \_\_bold\_\_, \_italic\_, \`code\`, \> blockquote, * list, --- hr, ~~strike~~, [alt]\(link) and ![alt]\(image.jpg).
