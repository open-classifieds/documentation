After adding the possibility of creating custom fields on our 2.0.7 version, we added a new feature on our new release. With this feature you could **include any custom field you create into any selected category**.Â This walk-through will show you how you could do that easily with our new 2.1 version.

Our previous "How to" post showed you how you could [create and manage custom fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-create-custom-fields).

With our 2.1 release we added the option to **include different categories** within the custom field creation panel, as shown and indicated in the following screenshot:

With this option and by creating this custom field, it will be integrated into the "Housing", "Apartment" and "English" categories.

So lets try **publishing a new ad** in one of those categories:

We can see that, when I chose the "Apartment" category, our new custom field was shown automatically where the arrow is showing.

If you wanted to add a custom field to any ad published regardless of its category, you can simply **leave the category option empty** and your new custom field will show every time a new ad is being published.

I hope this was useful and there will be more posts that could help you build your classifieds website coming in the future!
