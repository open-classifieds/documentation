**Infinite ads** is a feature we introduced to our latest release 2.1.4. With this feature activated you can **see ads will be loading automatically** whenever the user scrolls down, without the need to click on a page number or next page.

**To activate infinite scroll** make sure that you're using one of the **[premium themes](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)** that currently support that feature (it would be mentioned in the theme description when you bought it) and follow the next steps:

1. Go to **Appearance** > **Theme options** 
2. Change **Infinite scroll** to **YES** 
3. Press **Update**

And it will be working perfectly!

Currently, this feature is only available in the following themes: **[Newspaper](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/newspaper.html)**, **[Olson](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/olson.html)**, **[Ocean Premium](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/ocean.html)**, **[Kamaleon](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/kamaleon.html)** and **[CZSale](http://market.open-classifieds.com/themes/czsale.html)**.
