As we have posted in our **[blog](http://open-classifieds.com/2014/02/12/elastic-email-review/)** earlier, you could now have **[ElasticEmail ](https://elasticemail.com/account#/open-classifieds)** integrated into your e-mailing function in Yclas. You can do that for multiple reasons, and some of them could be: your server can't send e-mails, e-mails not reaching users' inbox or you want to trace the e-mails you're sending.

### How it works

Here are the simple steps you need to do to have it integrated into your website: 

1. Set up an **[ElasticEmail](http://j.mp/elasticemailoc)** account 
2. Go to your panel, **Settings** -> **Email** -> **ElasticEmail**, switch **ElasticEmail** to **Enabled**.
3. Go to your ElasticEmail account https://elasticemail.com/account#/settings -> SMTP/API and copy the **API Key** and **Public Account ID**, paste to your website admin panel, **Settings** -> **Email** -> **ElasticEmail** and press **Save**.
4. Enter the **name of the list** that you want users to be automatically subscribed after they register. ElasticEmail provides instructions on [how you can create a list](https://elasticemail.com/support/user-interface/contacts/lists/create-new).
5. Press **Save**.

Now, every e-mail you send using the admin panel will be sent through your ElasticEmail account.
