<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></i> </strong> This feature is available on our 2.5.1 release.
</div>

With this feature, users have the option to change the primary image of their ad. If a user publishes an ad with five images, he can choose which image will be displayed as primary by editing the ad.

### How it works

Let's say you have published an ad with two images. This is how it's displayed on Listing page:

![primary-image](http://docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image.png)

If you want to change the primary image, you have to click to edit the ad and then click "Primary Image" under the image you want to mark as primary.

![primary-image1](http://docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image1.png)

This is the result!

![primary-image2](http://docs.yclas.com/images/primary-image2.png)


Notice that you can change the primary image as many times as you want!
