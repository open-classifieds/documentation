I was playing around with the user roles and accidentally changed the admin role to "1" instead of "10" on my admin account. Now I can't do anything as I don't have any admin permissions at all.

**If that happened to you here is the fix:** 

1. Login to your **cPanel** at your hosting 
2. Go to **phpMyAdmin** 
3. Select your **Openclassifieds database** 
4. Go to table **oc2_users** 
5. Search for your user and change the **id_role** to "**10**".

What is more, if you forgot your password and somehow the " **Forgot my password** " function wasn't working, you could fix that by registering a new user and following the above mentioned steps to make the **new user admin**.
