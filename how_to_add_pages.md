2\. Fill **in the fields:**

  * **Title**: choose the title of the page e.g. Terms of Service.
  * **Locale**: select from the list of available locales the one you're currently using. Make sure it's the correct one. Otherwise page won't be displayed.
  * **Description**: paste here the content of the page. You can use formatting, include images etc. To paste **html switch** to **Source mode** \- click last button in the text editor (view source).
  * **Seotitle**
  * **Status**: make sure the box is checked, only then the site will be active.

3\. Press **CREATE**

After deleting cache (go to **Tools** > **Cache** and hit **Delete All**) your site will be available at URL build according to this scheme: http://your_site.com/chosen_seotitle.html

## Widget

If you want links to all your pages be always accessible, e.g. in the sidebar use **Pages widget**. To activate it click **Appearance > Widgets** in the left sidebar of the Panel. Choose widget **'Pages'** and hit **Create**. Choose the place where it will be displayed - it is title - and save changes.
