This new feature makes it easier to communicate between seller and buyer about an ad. Instead of having a contact form on the advertisement's page, you can activate Messaging System and have a form that sends a message to the seller. Using this way, you can avoid sharing email address and seller can choose with whom to communicate.

### How to enable Messaging System

To enable messaging system, you simply need to login to your Panel, go to **Settings** -> **General** and set **Activates Messaging System = ON**.

Now, buyers can contact the seller through the messaging system.

### How it works

On advertisement's page, click **Send Message**. Then, a contact form will appear in a popup window, where you can enter your message to the seller, the price you want to pay about the ad and fill out the captcha field.

If your message has been sent, you can see it on your **Messages**.

If you are a seller and someone contacted you about your ad, you will see a notification when you log in to the website.

To view and reply to this message, click on **Messages** and then on the message.

Enter your reply and click **Reply**.


**Since our [2.5.1 release](http://open-classifieds.com/2015/09/10/open-classifieds-2-5-1/), new options have added to the messaging system.**

Now you can delete messages or mark them as spam. 

### Spam

If you have been contacted for an ad, but you think the message is a spam, you can mark it as spam.

![message system](http://docs.yclas.com/images/messaging-system.png)

Now you can find this message under the Spam tab.

If a sender tries to contact you again, then you won't be notified, but the new message will be received under the Spam tab and you can read it if you click on the conversation with this sender.

### Delete

If you have a lot of old messages that you don't want into your inbox, now you can delete them. Open the message you want to delete and click Delete.

![message system1](http://docs.yclas.com/images/messaging-system2.png)

Now you can see this message does not appear in your inbox anymore.
