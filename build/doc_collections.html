<h2 id="what-are-collections">What are collections</h2>

<p>Collections are custom content types different from pages and posts. You might create a collection if you want to treat a specific set of articles in a unique way, such as with a custom layout or listing. For more detail on collections, see <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/">Ben Balter&#39;s explanation of collections here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-collection">Create a collection</h2>

<p>To create a collection, add the following in your configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>collections:
  tooltips:
    output: true
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, &quot;tooltips&quot;&quot; is the name of the collection.</p>

<h2 id="interacting-with-collections">Interacting with collections</h2>

<p>You can interact with collections by using the <code>site.collectionname</code> namespace, where <code>collectionname</code> is what you&#39;ve configured. In this case, if I wanted to loop through all tooltips, I would use <code>site.tooltips</code> instead of <code>site.pages</code> or <code>site.posts</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">Collections in the Jekyll documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-collections">How to use collections</h2>

<p>I haven&#39;t found a huge use for collections in normal documentation. However, I did find a use for collections in generating a tooltip file that would be used for delivering tooltips to a user interface from text files in the documentation. See  for details.</p>
