<h2 id="theme-options">Theme options</h2>

<p>You can choose a green or blue theme, or you can create your own. In the css folder, there are two theme files: theme-blue.css and theme-green.css. These files have the most common CSS elements extracted in their own CSS file. Just change the hex colors to the ones you want.</p>

<p>In the configuration file, specify the theme file you want the output to use &mdash; for example, <code>theme_file: theme-green.css</code>.</p>

<h2 id="theme-differences">Theme differences</h2>

<p>The differences between the themes is fairly minimal. The main navigation bar, sidebar, buttons, and heading colors change color. That&#39;s about it. </p>

<p>In a more sophisticated theming approach, you could use Sass files to generate rules based on options set in a data file, but I kept things simple here.</p>
