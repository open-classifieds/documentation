<h2 id="about-exclusion">About exclusion</h2>

<p>By default, all files in your project are included in your output (regardless of whether they&#39;re listed in the sidebar_doc.yml file or not). To exclude files, note them in the <code>exclude</code> section in the configuration file. Here&#39;s a sample:</p>

<pre><code>
exclude: 
  - doc_writers_*
  - bower_components
  - Gemfile
</code></pre>

<p>If you have different outputs for your site, you&#39;ll want to customize the exclude sections in your various configuration files.</p>

<h2 id="exclude-strategies">Exclude strategies</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the process I recommend. Put all files in the root directory of your project. Suppose one project&#39;s name is alpha and the other is beta. Then name each file as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>alpha_sample.html</li>
<li>beta_sample.html</li>
</ul>

<p>In your exclude list for your beta project, specify it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>exclude: 
- alpha_*
</code></pre>

<p>In your exclude list for your alpha project, specify it as follows:</p>

<pre><code>exclude:
- beta_*
</code></pre>

<p>If you have more sophisticated exclusion, add another level to your file names. For example, if you have different programming languages you want to filter by, add this:</p>

<ul>
<li>alpha_java_sample.html</li>
<li>alpha_cpp_sample.html</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you exclude files for your Alpha C++ project as follows:</p>

<pre><code>exclude: 

- alpha_java_*
- beta_*
</code></pre>

<p>And you exclude files for your Alpha Java project as follows:</p>

<pre><code>exclude:

- alpha_cpp_*
- alpha_beta_*
</code></pre>

<p>When you exclude folders, include the trailing slash at the end of the folder name:</p>

<pre><code>exclude:
- images/alpha/
</code></pre>

<p>There isn&#39;t a way to automatically exclude anything. By default, everything is included unless you explicitly list it under the exclude section.</p>

<h2 id="excluding-draft-content">Excluding draft content</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re working on a draft, put it inside the _drafts folder or add <code>published: false</code> in the frontmatter. The _drafts folder is excluded by default, so you don&#39;t have to specify it in your exclude list. </p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>What if a file should appear in two projects but not the third? This can get tricky. For some files, rather than using a wildcard, you may need to manually specify the entire filename that you&#39;re excluding instead of excluding it by way of a wildcard pattern.</p>
