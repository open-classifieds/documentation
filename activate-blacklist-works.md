The **black list** function **blocks the users that published any ad that you marked as spam** from posting again. In simple words, you mark an ad as spam and the user who posted that ad can no longer post any ad again.

**How to activate?** 

1. Log in to your **Admin Panel**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Plugins**.
3. Set **Black list** value to **ON**.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blacklist.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![Black list]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blacklist.png)
</a>

<br>
Once you do that, whenever you mark an ad as spam you will receive a **warning message** saying that the e-mail related to the user who published that ad is now blacklisted and prevented from posting.

To see a **full list of blacklisted users** follow those steps: 

1. Log in to your **Admin Panel** 
2. Go to **Users** > **Black list** 

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blacklist1.png" class="thumbnail gallery-item" data-gallery>
![Black list]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blacklist1.png)
</a>
