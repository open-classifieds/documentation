We referred to this in many areas at our site, that if you **[purchase a web hosting](http://open-classifieds.com/hosting/)**, you are entitled to:

* a free **[Premium Theme](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)** from Open Classifieds, worth $185 or a discount of $185.
* 1 free lifetime license,
* 3 months of support from OC team,
* a decent 50% discount from Inmotion.

So it is a very good deal! 

**Once you do the purchase, [contact us](http://open-classifieds.com/contact/) with the following information:**

- The **e-mail** you are going to use for purchase 
- Your **domain** 
- Your **Inmotion hosting ID**, which you can find in your receipt (looks like this IMH -XXX - XXXXXX) 
- Your **preferred theme** (selected from our **[Premium Themes](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)** ) 

You can send the above information through the following contact page:

Once you send us the information, we will provide you with the free theme and guide you through the process, until your website is up and running.
