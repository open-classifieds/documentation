Note that the Featured Plans are available only for the Premium Users. When you 're ready to have a Premium Theme, go to our [market](http://open-classifieds.com/market/).

With our 2.4.0 release, we added the option to create featured plans for ads.

This feature allows you to give users the option to select between different length of the featured of their ad and pay according to your plans.

If you don't know how to enable featured ads, please follow [this guide](http://docs.yclas.com/setup-payment-gateways/)!


## How to create a Featured Plan:

1. Log in to your Admin Panel.
2. **Settings** -> **Payments**, **Add a plan**
3. Fill the fields and click **Save plan**

Now, when a user clicks to feature his/her ad, it will bring him/her to the checkout page to choose which plan he needs to buy.

We hope that with our new Open Classifieds solutions managing your website is becoming easier! And remember that this is a premium feature which you can now get started from [a small fee of 3.49$ a month](http://open-classifieds.com/hosting/)
