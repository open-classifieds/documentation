Here we present another cool thing that you can do on your site. It is possible to place a **full width Google map** at your homepage like this:

To do it you need to use a **[premium theme](http://open-classifieds.com/market/)**. In theme options, go to the **header banner** and **paste this HTML**: 

    <iframe frameborder="0" noresize="noresize" height="620px" width="100%" src="http://**YOURDOMAIN**.com/map.html?height=600&amp;controls=0&amp;**zoom=11**&**lat=41.390359&lon=2.179031**"> </iframe>

In this code you can set the **zoom**Â (the higher number the closer location appears) and **latitude** and **longitude** of the location you want to put in center of the map as a default view. To find out about exact coordinates of any point you can use for example this **[tool](http://www.itouchmap.com/latlong.html)**.
