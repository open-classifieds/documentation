This feature allows you to manage the topics of your forum. 

First of all, you need to have forums activated on your website. _If you don't know how to activate forums, you can follow the steps in [this guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/add-forums-section)._ 

So, if you have forums activated and topics created you are able to manage those topics. 

Go to **Panel** and select **Content** -> **Topics** to see all the topics of your forum.
