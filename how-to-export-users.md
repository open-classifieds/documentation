A new feature is now available and it allows you to export users to CSV. It's very easy, just follow these steps:

+ Go on **Panel**, **Users** -> **Users**.
+ Click **EXPORT ALL** at the right bottom of the page.

![export users](http://docs.yclas.com/images/export-users.png)

+ Save or Open the generated CSV file.

Now you have a table containing users' details such as _name_, _email_, _description_, _id-role_, the number of _logins_, _last login_, if he/she is a _subscriber_, _rate_ and more.
